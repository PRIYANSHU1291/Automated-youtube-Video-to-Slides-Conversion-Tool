# Automated-youtube-Video-to-Slides-Conversion-Tool
Before modification, this project was a simple Python tool that downloaded a YouTube video using yt-dlp and extracted slides by saving every fixed number of frames with OpenCV. It stored the extracted images in a folder, making it easy to capture key frames from lectures, presentations, or other video content.
